I see a lot of people get this wrong when they’re trying to talk to the internet, so here are some tips:
### Do not pander to the internet
If you only take away one thing from this post, remember this. What I mean by this is that to talk to the internet you don’t need its language. Unless you’re describing them (and be careful if you are) you should avoid using them. Despite what some may tell you, if there’s one thing the internet is good at, it’s reading. They read every day, even if not in a conventional way. They will understand you regardless of whether you capitalize your Is or use acronyms. If you’re an outsider looking in, talk the way you usually do. Additionally, memes: Don’t. Memes are observed in a vacuum of sorts and not in the middle of an article or a classroom. Don't put them there. It’s also probably unlikely that you’ll make memes that the internet would even like, so don’t.
### Avoid ads
People on the internet hate ads. People in the world hate ads. If I will go through the lengths to install external software to get it out, you’d probably do good to not add it, though for some this isn’t feasible. This of course only applies to people who are communicating online.
### Speak like they’re the same as you
People on the internet are (mostly for now) just that: people. Speak to them that way.
### Don’t use AI.
AI is not cool. Stop. Please. There are so many reasons to hate AI, please read about them.
