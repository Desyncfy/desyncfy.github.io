      Online voting is super stupid. It sounds great in theory, but there are so so so many issues with it that are impossible to solve. I've compiled a list:
      <ol>
        <li>Verifying the votes: How can you verify your digital vote is counted?</li>
        <li>Verifying the software: How can you verify that the software you're using to vote is secure? How can you verify that the code is written by a group that won't rig it? Even if all parts of the software, from the app/website to the server were open source and that code was super secure (which is very unlikely it would most likely be closed source and out of date) how can I verify the servers are running that code? You can't.</li>
        <li>Verifying the voter: How can you verify that you didn't log into the website and then hand it to someone else?</li>
        <li>DDoS Protection: What happens if servers get DDoS'd and certain people can't vote?</li>
      </ol>

      This was something I made a few days ago, but I thought I'd upload it here anyway.
